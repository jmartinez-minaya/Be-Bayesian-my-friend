
# Welcome to the course Be Bayesian my friend!

This is a course for everyone who want to start learning Bayesian Inference. I hope I can help you understand Bayesian inference as much as I would like to.

**Are you ready?**

**Let's go!**


## Program

The course is divided in two parts combining theoretical and practical aspects, and the idea is to teach it in two hours.

**PART I: Introduction to Bayesian inference**. History of Bayes theorem. Bayes theorem. Bayesian inference. Posterior distribution. Credible intervals. Predictive distribution.
 
**PART II: Hierarchical Bayesian models**. Definition. Computation. MCMC methods. Metropolis Hastings. An application to disease mapping. 

## Software

To take full advantage of the course, it is necessary that everyone has the following programs installed:

- version 4.0.0 of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) or posterior, and
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
- [OpenBUGS]( https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/openbugs/)

## R packages

This will be the packages required for the course

```r
install.packages(pkgs = c("ggplot2", "gridExtra", "maptools", "rgdal", "spdep", "lattice", "latticeExtra", "viridis", "splancs", "lattice", "fields", "plotKML", "raster", "sp", "R2OpenBUGS", "LearnBayes", "dplyr", "coda"))

```
